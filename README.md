# :sparkles: Hello there ! :sparkles:

My name is Pauline and I am a Web and Mobile Developper ! 👩🏻‍💻   

After 5 years as a Marketing Manager, I decided to shift careers and discovered coding through Codeademy and Free Code Camp. To give me a boost and learn faster, I decided to enroll in a Bootcamp Training @ Le Reacteur, focusing on Fullstack Web and Mobile Development.

With the technical knowledge I gained from this intensive Bootcamp, and the soft skills I acquired in my previous experiences, such as team work & project management, I am now ready to take over the world of development :earth_africa: (or at least start out with a cool internship !)
